# Artemis Hunting MVP

## Overview

Artemis Hunting MVP is a commercial application for microfinance field agents (loan officers/credit agents). The app enables agents to manage their credit portfolio, track proposals through various pipeline stages, monitor KPIs, and originate new credit proposals on tablets in the field.

The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence. Currently, the frontend uses mock data for development purposes while the backend infrastructure is in place.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state and caching
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens for the Artemis brand (blue primary, yellow secondary, green accent)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Target Device**: Optimized for tablet usage (~1024px width)

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **API Pattern**: RESTful endpoints defined in `shared/routes.ts` with Zod schemas for validation
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- **Build System**: Custom build script using esbuild for server bundling and Vite for client

### Data Layer
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` - defines Drizzle tables and Zod insert schemas
- **Core Entities**:
  - Proposals: Credit applications with statuses (on_going, under_evaluation, completed)
  - Contracts: Active loans with statuses (active, renewal_due, delinquent)
- **Mock Data**: `client/src/mock/data.ts` provides development data for frontend testing
- **Database Migrations**: Managed via `drizzle-kit push` command

### Shared Code Pattern
The `shared/` directory contains code used by both frontend and backend:
- `schema.ts`: Database table definitions and TypeScript types
- `routes.ts`: API route definitions with Zod schemas for type-safe API contracts

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Mock-first Development**: Frontend uses local mock data hooks that simulate API delays, enabling frontend development independent of backend
2. **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety through shared Zod schemas between client and server
3. **Component Library**: shadcn/ui provides accessible, customizable components that follow Radix UI patterns
4. **Path Aliases**: TypeScript path aliases (`@/`, `@shared/`) for clean imports

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store, connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component implementations
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with HMR
- **esbuild**: Server bundling for production
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migration tooling
